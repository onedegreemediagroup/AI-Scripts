# AI Scripts

A place to collect scripts I've written (or will write) for Adobe Illustrator.  Unless otherwise noted, tested only in latest version of Creative Cloud (currently, Illustrator CC 2018).

## MakeBrushCatalog.jsx
I've collected a number of AI Brushes over the years, but often the creators of the brushes won't include a catalog of what brushes are in the AI document. This script creates a grid of rectangles (width, height, padding, and # of columns are customizable in the script), and applies each brush (from the Brush Panel) to a rectangle.  Then, adds the brush name as a label inside of each rectangle.
